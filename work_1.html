								<p class="fh5co-lead">Smile Mind is a non-profit organization that seek to help all minds thrive. The aim of Smiling Mind is to bring about a generational shift in mental health in Australia. Their lifelong, evidence-based tools provide the fundamental mental fitness skills needed to support good mental health and resilience from an early age.</p>
								<p>I worked on this case study for a period of five (5) weeks in a remote team around the world, focused on trying to study about how Smiling Mind began primarily for younger students but now they want to better serve the hybrid and remote workforce.</p>
								<p>The task was to better understand this user segment and help the Smiling Mind team better understand the needs and goals of those working remotely or hybrid looking to try meditation.</p>

								<p class="fh5co-lead">After successfully conducting our research interviews, we created a survey which was distributed to our target users (remote/hybrid workers). This survey was made up of closed and open ended questions. The purpose of the survey was to help us get quantitative and qualitative insights about users.

								<br>
								<br>
								<p>We benchmarked against two competitiors for this case study. Namely <b>“Calm”</b> and <b>“HeadSpace”</b>. This benchmarking was done so we could have a standard to refer to as we improved the product (Smiling Mind). This was also to draw inspiration and to check existing UX and UI standards.</p>

									<li><b>Errors: </b> That is, the errors users make, the severity of those errors and the ease with which users can bounce back from those errors.</li>
									<li><b>Satisfaction: </b> That is, how much users enjoy the interface and completing tasks within it.</li>

							</div>
							<div class="col-md-9">
								<p>We conducted moderated and unmoderated usability tests to help us identify problems and potential improvements to check if users understand the navigation, observe how easily and quickly people accomplish tasks with Smiling Mind. Users undertook a total of four (4) tasks based on scenarios presented them. Below are some of the results of unmoderated tests.</p>

								<h3 class="fh5co-section-heading"><span class="fh5co-number">N<sup>o</sup> 9</span> Results Synthesis</h3>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-9">
								<p class="fh5co-lead">After collecting data from our respondents, we had to breakdown the information to generate actionable insights. This was achieved using Dovetail, a tool for capturing customer feedback and user research in one place. It acts as user research repository for centralising interview notes and storing video and images, with tagging and annotations to help with analysis.</p>
								<br>
								<img src="images/synthesis.jpg" alt="plan text" class="col-md-12">
								<br>
								<p>From analysis of data gathered from users, we deduced that 65.33% were irritated by the voices of coaches on the meditation app and hence would drop off without completing a session. Whereas 34.67% preferred to be guided through out a session. This would mean that smiling mind would have to include the ability of their users to opt for coaches for a session or develop a different type of meditation where the user would not require a coach.</p>
								<br>
								<img src="images/synthesis.jpg" alt="plan text" class="col-md-12">
								<p>It was also deduced as seen from above that 18.51% of our respondents tried meditation in order to have clarity of mind to carry out their basic activities and duties. To help users achieve that, meditation sessions should be tailored towards enabling users to achieve clarity whenever they decide to join a session on the App.</p>

								<p class="fh5co-lead">After the information was synthesized, we pulled all of our relevant findings together in a digestible, easy to read format, with conclusions and recommendations. The aim is to make it easy for all stakeholders to have a quick read and understand the insights from this research so that important discussions and decisions can be made.</p>

								<h3 class="fh5co-section-heading"><span class="fh5co-number">N<sup>o</sup> 11</span> Lessons Learned</h3>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-9">
								<p class="fh5co-lead">One very difficult part during this case study was accepting that we were not the users. During the moderated usability tests, we thought everything was extremely clear and basic and we were tempted to help out users to complete the tasks stated in each scenario. It made me realise that UX professionals must be able to get out of their own heads, interact with a cross-section of users, empathize with them, and apply what they’ve shared to the product development process.</p>
								<p>Another important lesson learnt is to always have a research plan. Having a research plan really helped to make use of time and resources efficiently, decide what is to be done and why it should be done and it helped to focus on one thing at a time.</p>
